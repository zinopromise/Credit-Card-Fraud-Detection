# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Using simple regression model to detect credit card fradulent transaction in an European country
## The Scope of the Analysis
Supervised machine learning by Regression is the type of learning where the outcome is a numerical variable.
This project uses simple regression models to detect fradulent credit card transactions in September, 2013 by European users.
<br> The dataset used contains only numerical variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
Due to confidentiality, the original feature names and more data cannot be provided.
<br> Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
## Source of Dataset
The dataset is an open source dataset gotten from kaggle.com and uploaded by Machine Learning Group - ULB.
<br> The dataset cannot be uploaded to GitHub because of its file size.
